# SDP
Implement and compare Depthwise Convolution, and Pointwise Convolution
##Introduction
Convolution operations are essential in image and signal processing but often require high computation. Depthwise and Pointwise Convolutions make these operations more efficient in terms of speed and memory. FPGAs, with their parallelism and flexibility, are well-suited for implementing such methods. This project compares both techniques on FPGA to analyze performance, resource usage, and efficiency.
